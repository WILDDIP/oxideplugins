**Whitelist** restricts access to your server, only allowing players who have the 'whitelist.allowed' permission from Oxide.

**Permissions**

This plugin uses Oxide's permission system. To assign a permission, use **grant user <username|steamid> <permission>**. To remove a permission, use **revoke user <username|steamid> <permission>**.


* 
**whitelist.allowed** (allows player to connect to the server)
**Ex.** grant user Wulf whitelist.allowed
**Ex.** revoke user Wulf whitelist.allowed
**Ex.** grant group admin whitelist.allowed


**Localization**

There is currently no way to change the message kicked players see. I may have to change to a different hook to allow custom messages.
